## What is Borderless Gaming?

**Borderless Gaming** is a powerful and versatile software solution designed to transform traditional fullscreen or windowed games into a seamless **borderless windowed mode**. Unlike conventional fullscreen modes that often introduce stuttering, input lag, or frustrating delays when switching between applications, borderless mode ensures a fluid and uninterrupted user experience. This allows gamers, streamers, and multitaskers to effortlessly alt-tab between their game and other desktop applications—such as web browsers, Discord, or streaming software—without causing the game to minimize, freeze, or drop in performance.

The utility is compatible with a vast library of PC games, from indie titles to AAA blockbusters like **Minecraft** and **Metro Exodus**, making it an essential tool for any modern gaming setup. By automating the process of forcing a game into a borderless window, it removes technical barriers and lets users focus entirely on their immersion and productivity. Its foundation as a free, open-source project on GitHub ensures transparency, community-driven improvements, and trustworthiness, cementing its status as a go-to utility for enhancing the PC gaming experience across Windows 10 and Windows 11 environments.
